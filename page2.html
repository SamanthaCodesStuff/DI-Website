    <h1>Who is Abigail?</h1>


    <p class="text">Abigail is a villager who lives at Pierre's General Store in Pelican Town. 
        She is one of the twelve characters available to marry.</p>

    <p class="text">“Abigail lives at the general store with her parents. She sometimes fights with her mom, 
         who worries about Abigail’s “alternative lifestyle”. Her mom has the following to say: “I wish Abby would dress more appropriately and stop dyeing her hair blue. 
         She has such a wonderful natural hair color, just like her grandmother did. Oh, and I wish she’d find some wholesome interests instead of this occult nonsense she’s into.”
         You might find Abigail alone in the graveyard, or maybe out in a rainstorm looking for frogs.”</p>

    <h1>Why Abigail?</h1>

    <p class="text">Abigail is the best wife because she is very adventorous and gives you a lot of stuff if
        you marry her and she is very nice. Her father (not really, her mum cheated) is also a really corrupt person who controls over the economy
        and I hate him so much because he makes sunflower seeds so goddamn expensive so I  think that she is better living
        with someone who isnt a <strong id="lunatic">lunatic</strong>
        
    </p>
    
    <h1>Wha else is good about Abigail?</h1>
    
    <p class="text">She has a guinea pig and helps out with things around your farm,
        like feeding your pet, fixing your fences, and petting the farm animals.
